# Deploying menu3d

Two backend paths are documented below - pick one:

- **Option A: Render (free tier) + Vercel** - fastest to set up, no server to
  manage, good for getting a real URL live quickly.
- **Option B: VPS (Docker + Caddy) + Vercel** - `docker-compose.yml` and
  `Caddyfile` in this repo are built for this; use it once you need more than
  Render's free tier gives you (it sleeps after 15 min idle, wakes up slowly).

Both options deploy the three frontends (`admin`, `super-admin`, `customer`)
to Vercel as three separate projects.

## Option A: Render + Vercel

### A.1 Database

Render's free plan doesn't include Postgres, so use a free external one -
[Neon](https://neon.tech) or [Supabase](https://supabase.com) both work.
Create a project, copy its Postgres connection string (`postgres://...`) -
that's your `DATABASE_URL`.

### A.2 Backend (Render)

New → Web Service → connect this repo:

- **Root Directory**: `backend`
- **Environment**: Docker (it will find `backend/Dockerfile`)
- **Instance Type**: Free
- **Health Check Path**: `/health/`

Environment variables (Render dashboard → Environment, not a file):

| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| `SECRET_KEY` | generate: `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(50))"` |
| `DEBUG` | `False` |
| `ALLOWED_HOSTS` | `<your-service-name>.onrender.com` (pick the service name up front so you know this before deploying) |
| `DATABASE_URL` | the Neon/Supabase connection string from A.1 |
| `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | the 3 Vercel URLs from A.3, comma-separated, no trailing slash |
| `FRONTEND_BASE_URL` | the customer app's Vercel URL (baked into every table's QR code) |
| `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | from your Cloudflare R2 dashboard |
| `CLOUDFLARE_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | R2 API token |
| `CLOUDFLARE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | R2 API token |
| `CLOUDFLARE_R2_BUCKET` | R2 bucket name |
| `CLOUDFLARE_R2_PUBLIC_URL` | R2 bucket's public URL |
| `AISTUDIO_TOKEN` | 3daistudio.com API token |
| `WEB_CONCURRENCY` | `2` (free tier has 512MB RAM - the default of 3 gunicorn workers can OOM it) |

Do **not** set `PORT` - Render injects it itself and `entrypoint.sh` already
binds to it (`${PORT:-8000}`).

Media uploads (`CLOUDFLARE_*`) are required here even for testing - Render's
filesystem is ephemeral, so without R2 every uploaded image disappears on the
next deploy or restart.

Deploy, then open a shell (Render dashboard → Shell) and run:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Migrations and `collectstatic` already ran automatically on boot
(`backend/entrypoint.sh`). Re-deploys are automatic on every push to `main`
by default.

### A.3 Frontends (Vercel)

Create three separate Vercel projects from this repo, one per app, each with
its **Root Directory** set accordingly:

| Vercel project | Root Directory |
|---|---|
| menu3d-admin | `frontend/admin` |
| menu3d-super-admin | `frontend/super-admin` |
| menu3d-customer | `frontend/customer` |

Same single environment variable on all three:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://<your-service-name>.onrender.com
```

This is inlined at build time, so redeploy on Vercel after changing it.

Once you have the three `*.vercel.app` URLs, go back to Render's
`CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` and set those exact origins, then redeploy the
backend - cookie auth will 401 silently otherwise (blocked by CORS, not a
login bug).

### A.4 First-time checks

- `https://<your-service-name>.onrender.com/health/` returns `{"status": "ok"}`.
- First request after idle takes ~30-60s on the free tier (cold start) -
  expected, not a bug.
- Log into the admin app; if it hangs on "loading", check the browser's
  network tab for CORS errors first (see A.3's last paragraph).
- Render dashboard → Logs for gunicorn/Django errors.

## Option B: VPS (Docker + Caddy) + Vercel

Requirements: a VPS with Docker + the Docker Compose plugin installed, and a
domain (e.g. `api.yourdomain.com`) with its DNS A record pointed at the VPS's
IP - Caddy needs that to work before it can issue a certificate.

```bash
git clone <this repo> menu3d && cd menu3d

# Root env (Caddy + Postgres)
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env: set DOMAIN and a real POSTGRES_PASSWORD

# Backend env (Django)
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# edit backend/.env - required:
#   SECRET_KEY            (generate: python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(50))")
#   DEBUG=False
#   ALLOWED_HOSTS          e.g. api.yourdomain.com
#   CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS   the 3 Vercel URLs, comma-separated, no trailing slash
#   FRONTEND_BASE_URL      the customer app's URL (baked into every table's QR code)
#   CLOUDFLARE_*           R2 bucket for uploaded images (required whenever DEBUG=False)
#   AISTUDIO_TOKEN         3daistudio.com API token
# DATABASE_URL is set for you by docker-compose.yml - leave it blank here.

docker compose up -d --build
docker compose exec backend python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Migrations and `collectstatic` run automatically on container start
(`backend/entrypoint.sh`). The API is now live at `https://<DOMAIN>/`.

Redeploying after a code change:

```bash
git pull
docker compose up -d --build backend
```

Note: `backend` isn't published to the host — only Caddy (ports 80/443) is.
That's what makes it safe for gunicorn to speak plain HTTP internally.

Frontends: same as Option A.3, but `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://<DOMAIN>`.

First-time checks: same as A.4, but `docker compose logs -f backend` /
`docker compose logs -f caddy` instead of the Render dashboard (check Caddy's
logs if the certificate isn't issuing - usually a DNS or port 80/443
firewall issue).
